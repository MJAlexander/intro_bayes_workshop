# Introduction to Bayesian models
Materials for intro to Bayesian models workshop given at MPIDR as part of the [Population and Social Data Science Summer Incubator Program](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_events_6123/news_press_releases_4630/news/population_and_social_data_science_summer_incubator_program_2024_13112). 

## Packages to install

If you would like to follow along with the coded examples, you will need to install the following packages:


- `tidyverse`
- `rstan`
- `rstanarm`
- `tidybayes`
- `janitor`

The `rstan` package is probably to most important but also the most annoying to install. See detailed instructions here: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

## New stuff from last year!

- Added questions in lab to allow for a moment of self-reflection
- Added an example in lab with partially observed data (using simulated data)
